\section{Conclusion}
Our system has been tested and functions per specification. It scales up well and can achieve an above than expected level of accuracy. 
As with any project, there are things one wishes to have done. After verifying the correctness of the system, we wanted to conduct a few experiments to figure out some quantitative characteristics of the system. One can see that there is a definite relationship between the number of nodes and time to convergence. There is also a difference in time to convergence between the different operations and that the distribution of values has an influence.  We wanted to estimate the rate of convergence for every mathematical operation. The first experiment provided us with some data that can be used to make a general analysis, but a deeper statistical analysis is need to come up with an actual model. Also, the network topology we chose, though simple, is very inflexible in how many nodes we could spawn. If we had more time, we would have probably chosen a better topology. One that had characteristics that lend it better to easier analysis.
