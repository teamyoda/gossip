\section{Introduction}
We designed and implemented a distributed system that uses rumor spreading (gossip) for communication and calculations. The system had to perform the following calculations: minimum, maximum, average, and median. The system had to have the ability to distribute and update a file among nodes. A key property that we strove toward during the design and implementation was scalability of this system. The system had to have reasonable run times with thousands of nodes. Also, the system was designed to work across multiple machines. After the system was implemented, we tested its functionality through well defined experiments.
