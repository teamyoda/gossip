These files contain sample output from the demos and experiments. For information on how to run these yourself, see the main README file in the directory above. Be sure to restart the Erlang interpreter between each test.

Some of these tests are randomized so exact results will vary. Also, a few of these examples produce much more output than shown here; only the last iteration is shown here for brevity and simplicity.

Also, exp1 outputs some information to the screen and the rest to a csv file. The screen output is in exp1.txt and the file 10k200_a.csv is also included here.
